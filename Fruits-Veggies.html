            <br>Apples are considered to be nutrient packed fruits. They offer vitamin  E which is a fat-soluble antioxidant,B1(or Thiamine) which is needed for growth development, & B6 which is essential protein metabolism.

Apples are known help against certain types of cancers such as lung, breast & digestive tract cancer.

Aside from eating them, you can use apples in many other ways such as ripening green tomatoes.

Another way you can use apples is including them in your workout ! Place an apple inbetween your thighs while you do crunches as this helps strengthen your core.
