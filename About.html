    <p>The plant is our home. Like any home it should be taken care of so it can remain clean. Keeping the enviorment clear is not only helpful for us but animals as well! With this, we believe that making gardens and reducing the waste is imparitve to having a clean earth.</p>

    <p>Our goals for the future is to start growing more gardenings in places like schools, communities, and other places that do not have gardens or aren't aware they can have them! We'll even educate more about how gardening works and what it helps to promote!</p>
