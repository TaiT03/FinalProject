            <h3>───────────────────────────────────────</h3>
            <p><h5>Ready to start your <i>radish</i>-ing garden? This page contains a simple 5-step guide on how to get ready for your garden! Before we start, it's good to know that not all of these gardening tips will work on all types of areas. These tips are geared towards city gardening!</h5></p>
        </div>

        <div class="howto">
            <ul>
                <li><h4>#1 - Decide what you'd like to grow in your home.</h4>
                    <p><b>Make sure your environment matches your choice.</b> Some fruits and veggies don't grow well or don't grow at all depending on the seasons or region. Make sure to look up your state or region to see what would grow best. It even helps to ask a local gardener what they grow.</p>

                    <p>If there are no common gardeners in your area to advise on what they tend to grow, or simply don't want them jalapeño business, try out this <a href="https://morningchores.com/planting-zones/"><i>Planting Zone Map</i> </a>website that provides a map to show the temperatures depending on your state.</p>

                    <p>The map will point out the temperatures depending on which state you live in. It allows you to see which veggies, fruits, or herbs you will be able to grow in that specific area!</p>

                <li><h4>#2 - Plan your garden beds.</h4>
                    <p><b>Once you know where you want your garden, decide on the type and size of garden bed(s).</b> Raised beds are attractive and may make it easier to work in your garden, but they also dry out more quickly. In very dry areas, sunken beds can be used to gather available moisture.</p>
                    
                    <P>Think about planting your garden in blocks or beds of plants instead of single rows. Beds should be 3 to 4 feet across; narrow enough that you can reach the center from either side. Beds should be roughly 10 feet long or less, so you're not tempted to step into the bed and compact the ground.</P>
                    
                    <p>Within the garden beds, place plants in rows or a grid pattern. The goal is to minimize walkways and to maximize growing space. You only add fertilizer and soil amendments to the planting area, which saves time and money. Work with companion plants to attract beneficial insects and improve yields.</p>
                
                    <p>Making proper <i>peas</i> with these beneficial insects will be better for you and your plants.</p>
                
                    <img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-uw06ilppdw/images/stencil/800x800/products/112/1591/441531231__93609.1651251737.jpg?c=2" alt="vertical planting beds" width="300px">
                
                    <p>Vertically growing crops allow you to squeeze more crops into less space. Plants like tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, and peas are great choices. Picking your <i>pear-fect</i> gardening beds can take <i>thyme</i>, just make sure to have the proper one for the veggies, herbs, and fruits you plan to grow.</p>
                
                    <p>- -</p></li>

                <li><h4>#3 - Buy basic planting tools.</h4>
                    <p><b>Use proper tools for your garden.</b> The relaxing art of gardening can be easily tarnished by the tools you use.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Garden hoe</li>

                        <li>Pruners</li>
                        <li>Garden carts</li>

                    <p><i>Lettuce</i> leave out all plastic and flimsy tools! Those types of tools can break easily, making gardening more tasking than relaxing. Keeping the tools clean and sharp is another important start.</p>

                <li><h4>#4 - Prepare your garden soil.</h4>
                    <p><b>Get the proper soil for your plants.</b> Someone starting out their garden may think "I don't <i>carrot</i> all about the soil! I'll just buy anything." While that was a nicely worded pun, soil is very important depending on its pH levels. Does it have a good amount of nutrients? Is there a mix of clay, rocks, silt? These are very important factors to take into account.</p>
                
                    <p>The most basic pH level that all plants like are around a 7 (a neutral pH level). However, potatoes tend to enjoy a more acidic leveled soil. Looking up which soils best suit your plant is also a great way to start.</p>
                
                    <img src="https://greenhousexpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GardenSoil.jpg" alt="Gardening soil">
                
                    <p>Most plants like a deep, well-drained, organically rich soil. Gardening tends to vary heavily on trial and error, along with figuring out what your plants like.</p>
                
                    <p>One pack of soil may not even be enough. Sometimes mixing two, three, or even four different types of soils are needed to get the plants the proper nutrients.</p>
                
                    <p>- -</p></li>

                <li><h4>#5 - Plant care.</h4>
                    <p><b>Most seed packets come with planting instructions.</b> As stated before, trial and error is important for gardening, no <i>beeting</i> around the bush for that! Try your best to follow the instructions on the packet.</p>
                
                    <p>The very simple rules of thumb for planting in the garden are as follows: planting seeds roughly 3 times as deep as the diameter of the seed; plants need one inch of watering per week during growing season; overwatering is as bad as underwatering.</p>
                
                    <img src="https://www.housesumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Gardening.jpg" alt="Plants" width="500px">
                
                    <p>Overwatering plants will lead to the rotting of the seeds and roots. You wouldn't wanna <i>kale</i> your little seedlings! Make sure to touch the soil to see if it's too damp or too dry before watering.</p>
                
                    <p>If you're worried about planting, make sure to check out the USDA's school gardening program that tends to talk more about planting depth, planting spacing, and days to germinate and days to harvest.</p>
