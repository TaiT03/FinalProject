   <h4>#1 - Decide what you'd like to grow in your home</h4>

   <div class="text">
   <p><b>Make your enviornment matches your choice.</b> Some fruits and veggies don't grow well or don't grow at all depending on the seasons or region. Make sure to look up your state or region to see what would grow best. It even helps to ask a local gardener what they grow.</p>

   <p>If there are no common gardeners in your area to say what they tend to grow, try out this <a href="https://morningchores.com/planting-zones/"><i>Planting Zone Map</i> </a>website that provides a map to show the temppatures depending on your state.</p>

   <p>The map will point out the tempatures of which state you live in. Allowing you to see which veggies, fruits, or herbs will be able to grow in that specific area!</p>

    <h4>#2 - Planning Garden Beds</h4>
    <p><b>Once you know where you want your garden, decide on the type and size of garden bed(s).</b> Raised beds are attractive and may make it easier to work in your garden, but they also dry out more quickly. In very dry areas, sunken beds can be used to gather available moisture.</p>
    
    <P>Think about planting your garden in blocks or beds of plants instead of single rows. Beds should be 3 to 4 feet across; narrow enough that you can reach the center from either side. Beds should be roughly 10 feet long or less, so your not tempted to step into the bed and compact the ground.</P>
    
    <p>Within the garden beds, place plants in rows or a grid pattern. The goal is minimize walkways and maximize growing space. You only add fertilizer and soil amendments to the planting area, which saves time and money. Work with companion plants to attract beneficial insects and improve yields.</p>

    <p>Vertically growing crops allow you to squeeze more crops into less space. Plants like tomatoes, beans, cucumbers, peas, and other plants.</p>

    <p>Lettuce leave out all plastic and flismy tools! Those types of tools can break easily, making gardening most tasking then relaxing. Keeping the tools clean and sharp is another important start.</p>

    <h4>4# - Building soil</h4>
    <P><b>Getting proper soil for the plants.</b> Someone starting out their garden may think 'I don't carrot all about the soil! I'll just buy anything'. While that was a nicely worded pun, soil is very important depending on it's pH levels, does it have good amount of nutrients, is their a mix of clay, rocks, silt? Vert important things to take into account.</P>

    <p>The most basic pH level that all plamts like are around a 7 (a netural ph level). However, potatoes tend to enjoy a more acidic leveled soil.</p>

    <img src="https://greenhousexpress.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GardenSoil.jpg" alt="Gardening soil">

    <p>Most plants like a deep, well-drained, organically rich soil. Gardening tends to vary heavily on trial and error, along with figuring out what your plants like.</p>

    <p>One pack of soil may not even be enough. Sometimes mixing two, three, or even four different types of soils are needed to get the plants the proper type of soil.</p>

    <h4>5# - Plant care</h4>
    <p><b>Most seed packets come with planting instructions.</b> As stated before, trail and error is important for gardening, no beeting around the bush for that! Try your best to follow the instructions on the packeting.</p>

    <p>The very simple rules of thumb for planting in the gardening is: planting seeds roughly 3 times as deep as the diameter of the seed, plants need one inch of watering per week during growing season, overwatering is as bad as underwatring.</p>

    <img src="https://www.housesumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Gardening.jpg" alt="Plants" width="500px">

    <p>overwatering plants will lead to the rotting of the seeds and roots. Make sure to touch the soil to see if it's too damp or too dry.</p>

    <p>If your worried about planting, make sure to check out the USDA's school gardening program that tends to talk more about planting dept, planting spacing, and days to germinate and days to harvest.</p>
